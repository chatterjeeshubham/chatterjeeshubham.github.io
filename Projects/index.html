<!--        We present a deep-learning framework, CrysXPP, to allow rapid prediction of electronic, magnetic and elastic properties of a wide range of materials with reasonable precision.-->
<!--        Although our work is consistent with several recent attempts to build deep learning-based property predictors, it overcomes some of their limitations.-->
<!--        CrysXPP lowers the need for a large volume of tagged data to train a deep learning model by intelligently designing an autoencoder CrysAE and passing the structural information to the property prediction process.-->
<!--        The autoencoder in turn is trained on a huge volume of untagged crystal graphs, the designed loss function helps in capturing all their important structural and chemical information.-->
<!--        Moreover, CrysXPP uses only a small amount of tagged data for property prediction, and also trains a feature selector that provides interpretability to the results obtained.-->
<!--        We demonstrate that CrysXPP convincingly performs better than all the competing and recent baseline algorithms across seven diverse set of properties.-->
<!--        Most notably, when given a small amount of experimental data, CrysXPP is consistently able to outperform conventional DFT.-->
<!--        We release the large pretrained model CrysAE so that it could be fine-tuned using small amount of tagged data by the research community on various applications with restricted data source.-->
